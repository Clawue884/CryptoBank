## 1. Prerequisites

Before deploying CryptoBank, ensure you have the following:

- A server or cloud instance with sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, Disk Space).
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on the server.
- Access to a terminal or command line interface.
- Basic knowledge of blockchain concepts and networking.

## 2. Environment Setup

### 2.1. Install Dependencies

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Git**: If you haven't already, install Git to clone the repository.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install git
   ```

3. **Clone the CryptoBank Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/CryptoBank.git
   cd CryptoBank
   ```

### 2.2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to define environment variables:

```plaintext
NODE_ENV=production
API_PORT=3000
DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/cryptobank
```

Adjust the values according to your environment.

## 3. Node Deployment

### 3.1. Using Docker

CryptoBank can be deployed using Docker for easy management and scalability.

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Start the Services**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:

   Check the logs to ensure all services are running correctly:

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

### 3.2. Manual Deployment

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can deploy manually:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Check the Application**:

   Access the API at `http://localhost:3000` to verify that it is running.

## 4. Scaling Strategies

### 4.1. Horizontal Scaling

- **Add More Nodes**: Deploy additional nodes to distribute the load. Each node can handle transactions and participate in consensus.
- **Load Balancer**: Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple nodes, improving performance and reliability.

### 4.2. Vertical Scaling

- **Upgrade Server Resources**: Increase the CPU, RAM, and disk space of existing nodes to handle higher loads.
- **Optimize Database Performance**: Use indexing and caching strategies to improve database query performance.

### 4.3. Caching

- **Implement Caching**: Use caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data and reduce database load.

## 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

### 5.1. Monitoring Tools

- **Use Monitoring Solutions**: Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track performance metrics, resource usage, and system health.
- **Set Alerts**: Configure alerts for critical metrics to proactively address issues.

### 5.2. Regular Maintenance

- **Update Software**: Regularly update the CryptoBank software to benefit from performance improvements and security patches.
- **Backup Data**: Implement regular backup procedures for critical data and configurations.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Node Not Starting**: Check the logs for error messages and ensure all dependencies are installed.
- **High Latency**: Monitor resource usage and consider scaling the infrastructure or optimizing the application.

### Debugging Tips

- Use logging to trace issues in the application.
- Test individual components to isolate problems.

## 7. Conclusion

Deploying and scaling the CryptoBank platform requires careful planning and execution. By following the guidelines outlined in this document, you can ensure a successful deployment and maintain optimal performance as your user base grows.
