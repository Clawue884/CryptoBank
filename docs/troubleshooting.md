## 1. Node Deployment Issues

### Node Fails to Start

**Symptoms**: The node does not start, and error messages are displayed in the logs.

**Solutions**:
- Check the logs for specific error messages. Use the following command to view logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```
- Ensure all dependencies are installed. If using Docker, make sure the image is built correctly:
  ```bash
  docker-compose build
  ```
- Verify that the environment variables in the `.env` file are correctly set.

### Node Sync Issues

**Symptoms**: The node is unable to sync with the network.

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection to ensure it is stable.
- Verify that the node is configured to connect to the correct peers. Update the peer list if necessary.
- Restart the node to attempt resynchronization.

## 2. Transaction Issues

### Transaction Pending for Too Long

**Symptoms**: A transaction remains in a pending state for an extended period.

**Solutions**:
- Check the current network status to see if there is congestion. Use the API endpoint to get network status:
  ```http
  GET /network/status
  ```
- If the transaction fee is too low, consider resending the transaction with a higher fee.
- Use a blockchain explorer to check the status of the transaction.

### Transaction Rejected

**Symptoms**: A transaction is rejected with an error message.

**Solutions**:
- Review the error message for details on why the transaction was rejected (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid address).
- Ensure that the transaction parameters (amount, recipient address) are correct.
- Check if the transaction exceeds the gas limit.

## 3. API Issues

### API Endpoint Not Responding

**Symptoms**: API requests return a timeout or error response.

**Solutions**:
- Verify that the API service is running. Check the logs for any errors:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs api
  ```
- Ensure that the API port is correctly configured in the `.env` file.
- Check for network issues that may be preventing access to the API.

### Invalid API Key

**Symptoms**: API requests return a 401 Unauthorized error.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure that you are including the correct API key in the request headers:
  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
  ```
- Verify that the API key has not expired or been revoked.

## 4. Smart Contract Issues

### Smart Contract Deployment Fails

**Symptoms**: An error occurs when attempting to deploy a smart contract.

**Solutions**:
- Check the smart contract code for syntax errors or logical issues.
- Ensure that the contract does not exceed the gas limit during deployment.
- Review the deployment parameters and ensure they are correct.

### Smart Contract Function Call Fails

**Symptoms**: A function call to a deployed smart contract fails.

**Solutions**:
- Verify that the function parameters are correct and match the expected types.
- Check the contract's state to ensure it allows the function to be called (e.g., proper access control).
- Review the transaction logs for any error messages.

## 5. Performance Issues

### Slow Transaction Processing

**Symptoms**: Transactions take longer than expected to be confirmed.

**Solutions**:
- Monitor network congestion and adjust transaction fees accordingly.
- Check the performance metrics of the nodes to identify any resource bottlenecks.
- Consider scaling the infrastructure by adding more nodes or upgrading existing resources.

### High Latency in API Responses

**Symptoms**: API responses are slow or delayed.

**Solutions**:
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce load on the database.
- Monitor server resource usage and optimize configurations as needed.
- Review the API code for any inefficient queries or processing logic.

## 6. General Troubleshooting Steps

- **Restart Services**: Sometimes, simply restarting the affected services can resolve issues.
  ```bash
  docker-compose restart
  ```
- **Check Documentation**: Refer to the official documentation for guidance on specific features or configurations.
- **Community Support**: Engage with the CryptoBank community through forums or chat groups for additional support and insights.
